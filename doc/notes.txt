I got the logs to go away by setting up react-devtools. Here are the steps (using React v0.48):

Install react-devtools: npm install -g react-devtools
Run react-devtools: react-devtools
In your project, edit node_modules/react-native/Libraries/Core/Devtools/setupDevtools.js by replacing 'localhost' with your development machine's IP address.
Build and run your project in Xcode.

find ip address: terminal: 
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
192.168.1.71
